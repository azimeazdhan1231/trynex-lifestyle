# Trynex Lifestyle eCommerce Store

## Overview

This is a full-stack eCommerce application built for a Bengali lifestyle and custom gift store. The application features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, using PostgreSQL as the database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The application is designed to be deployed on Replit with external database hosting.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared components:

- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for Replit deployment with the following approach:

1. **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with Express integration

   - Frontend: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
   - Backend: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: External PostgreSQL hosting with connection string configuration
4. **Environment Variables**: Database URL and other configuration via environment variables
5. **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets in production

### Build Process
- `npm run dev`: Development mode with hot reloading
- `npm run build`: Production build for both frontend and backend
- `npm run start`: Production server startup
- `npm run db:push`: Database schema deployment

The application is optimized for Replit's environment with specific plugins and configuration for seamless development and deployment experience.
