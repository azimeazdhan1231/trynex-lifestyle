# Complete Cloudflare Deployment Steps

## IMPORTANT: Your backend API is not connected. Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Add these files to your GitHub repository

**1. Create `functions/api/[[path]].js`** (ALREADY CREATED in your Replit)
   - This file contains all your API routes
   - Copy this file to your GitHub repository

**2. Create `_redirects`** (ALREADY CREATED in your Replit)
   - This file ensures API routes work correctly
   - Copy this file to your repository root

### Step 2: Update your GitHub repository manually

Since git operations are restricted here, you need to:

1. **Download these files from Replit:**
   - `functions/api/[[path]].js`
   - `_redirects`

2. **Upload to your GitHub repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com/yourusername/trynex-lifestyle
   - Create the `functions/api/` directory structure
   - Upload the `[[path]].js` file
   - Upload `_redirects` to the root directory

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Cloudflare

1. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Select your `trynex-lifestyle` project
3. Go to **Settings** > **Environment variables**
4. Add this variable:
   - **Name**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Supabase connection string
   - **Environment**: Production

### Step 4: Redeploy

1. In Cloudflare Pages, go to **Deployments**
2. Click **Retry deployment** on the latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

## Alternative: Quick Fix

If you want to test immediately, I can create a simplified version that works with static data first, then you can add the database later.

Would you like me to:
1. Create the GitHub upload files for you to copy manually? âœ…
2. Or create a simplified version that works without backend first?

Choose option 1 to get your full system working with database!
